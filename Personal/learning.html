                <p>Currently I have learned the basics along with functions in Python. I have found that there are large varieties of what
                    python can do as a language. Some of the aspects being able to pull date from csv files along with lists. Having the capability
                    to sift through the the files to find what an individual is looking for in specific years countries of origin.

                <p>Just like any skills that you start to learn and foster. At the start your skills are not the best. But with much practice
                  and use the skills that you learn grow. Just like how at the start of learning Python I found myself struggling with a simple loop
                  function. By the end of the my class I was able to write my own call functions by using the define function built in.

                <h3>Hard Question</h3>
                <p>Even though the start of my skills were there it raised a simple question in my mind. How can I improve upon the skills I am learning
                        now on my own. The simple answer was to just practice over and over again. Just like everything in life you have to continually
                        use the skills that you learn to make them a habit and second nature. Along with individual studdying habbits.
