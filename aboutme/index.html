    <h2>Jacob Eskola</h2>
    <h2>Hawk, Elf, Jake</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Jacob most people call me by Jake or Hawk
        only a few who know call me Elf. I have been single for a while now
        haven't had much opportunity to date since I am a full time construction
        worker and attending school. </p>
    <p>I love to exercise. I picked up a gym mebership not that long ago. Trying 
        to improve my health by exercising. I love to study my scriptures.
        The biggest thing that I love to do is archery practice as it is both relaxing
        and pure exercise. During the summer I tend to spend allot of time swimming or
        outdoors. Another activitey that I love to do is building computers. I have had a major fear
        of upgrading the ram on my laptop but I had to do it.
    </p>
    <p>I currently have a job/carrer I have been studying as an apprentice under my father
        as a Fourth generation carpet installer. Even tho the money can be great in it there is a flaw
        being that work is not stable. So I am pursuing an education that will lead me to
        greater job potential
    </p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
        for almost two years now. My favorite quote would have to be from President Dieter F. Uchtdorf
        "Doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith" As a convert in a family full of actual pegans
        I am constantly attacked with doubt filled questions. So this quote is a constant reminder to me.
        For myself all the scriptures are my favorite but the one that I love to study the most is the
        entirety of John 17. Now in the Book of Mormon it would have to be Ether 3:6 my friend who drove up
        from Utah to baptise me and than drove up again to attend my Endowment session told me to read Ether 3:6
        because it would hold a new meaning behind it.
